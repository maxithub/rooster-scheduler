# Rooster Scheduler

Rooster Scheduler is intended for building a simple open source enterprise scheduler 
application, which supports some key features that are missing from the open source 
Quartz scheduler, e.g. out-of-box support for invoking HTTP endpoints, and remote 
shells and job dependency.
